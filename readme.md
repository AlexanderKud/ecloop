## Build

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vladkens/ecloop.git && cd ecloop
make build
```

## Usage

```text
Usage: ./ecloop <cmd> [-t <threads>] [-f <filepath>] [-a <addr_type>] [-r <range>]

Compute commands:
  add             - search in given range with batch addition
  mul             - search hex encoded private keys (from stdin)
  rnd             - search random range of bits in given range

Compute options:
  -f <file>       - filter file to search (list of hashes or bloom fitler)
  -o <file>       - output file to write found keys (default: stdout)
  -t <threads>    - number of threads to run (default: 1)
  -a <addr_type>  - address type to search: c - addr33, u - addr65 (default: c)
  -r <range>      - search range in hex format (example: 8000:ffff, default all)
  -q              - quiet mode (no output to stdout; -o required)

Other commands:
  blf-gen         - create bloom filter from list of hex-encoded hash160
  bench           - run benchmark of internal functions
  bench-gtable    - run benchmark of ecc multiplication (with different table size)
```

### Check keys in given range (sequential addition)

`-f` is filter file with hash160 to search. Can be list of hex encoded hashes (one per line) or bloom fitler (must have `.blf` extension). `-t` use 4 threads. `r` ‚Äì start:end of search range. `-o` file where found keys should be saved (if not provided `stdout` fill be used). No `-a` option provided, so `c` (compressed) hash160 will be checked.

```sh
./ecloop add -f data/btc-puzzles-hash -t 4 -r 800000:ffffff -o /tmp/found.txt
```

### Check given privkeys list (multiply)

`cat privkeys.txt` ‚Äì source of HEX encoded priv keys to search (can be file or generator program). `-f` ‚Äì hash160 to search as bloom filter (can have false positive results, but has a much smaller size; eg. all BTC addresses ever used have size ~6GB). `-a` ‚Äì what type of hash160 to search (`c` ‚Äì compressed, `u` ‚Äì uncopressed, `cu` check both). `-t` use 8 threads.

```sh
cat privkeys.txt | ./ecloop mul -f data/btc-puzzles.blf -a cu -t 4
```

`ecloop` can also take a raw word list and automatically hash it with sha256. Use `-raw` flag to it.

```sh
cat wordlist.txt | ./ecloop mul -f data/btc-puzzles.blf -a cu -t 4 -raw
```

### Random Search

The `rnd` command allows you to search random ranges of bits within a given range (by default, the entire curve space). This mode is useful for exploring random subsets of the keyspace.

#### Example 1: Random Search with Default Offset and Size

```sh
./ecloop rnd -f data/btc-puzzles-hash -o ./found.txt -a cu -q
```

This command performs a random search across the entire keyspace, checking both compressed and uncompressed addresses (`-a cu`), and saves the results to `found.txt`. Quiet mode is enabled (`-q`).

Random bits offset will be used with a 32-bit range per iteration (4.2M keys).

#### Example 2: Random Search with Custom Offset and Size

```sh
./ecloop rnd -f data/btc-puzzles-hash -d 128:32
```

This command searches a 32-bit range with 128-bit offset (`-d 128:32`). It will execute a search with a random base key on each large iteration. Bits from `offset` to `offset + size` will be dynamic. For example (X is dynamic bits, other bits are randomly generated on large iterations):

```txt
iter1: d33abfe4b9152c08 7176d067XXXXXXXX 27d4419e6969a205 4d1deb10e4929621
iter2: 1b354d3094405c2f bf8f5c15XXXXXXXX 46804248255476e9 800f26edd71ad0d7
```

_Note: You can also combine random search with `-r` param for shorter ranges._

### Generating bloom filter

`cat` reads the list of hex-encoded hash160 values from a file. `-n` specifies the number of entries for the Bloom filter (count of hashes). `-o` defines the output where to write filter (`.blf` extension requried).

Bloom filter uses p = 0.000001 (1 in 1,000,000 false positive). You can adjusting this option by playing with `n`. See [Bloom Filter Calculator](https://hur.st/bloomfilter/?n=1024&p=0.000001&m=&k=20). List of all addressed can be found [here](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5265993.0).

```sh
cat data/btc-puzzles-hash | ./ecloop blf-gen -n 1024 -o /tmp/test.blf
```

Then created bloom filter can be used in `ecloop` as filter:

```sh
./ecloop add -f /tmp/test.blf -t 4 -r 8000:ffffff
```

_Note: Bloom filter works with all search commands (`add`, `mul`, `rnd`)._

## Benchmark

Get performance of different function for single thread:

```sh
./ecloop bench
```

Should print output like:

```sh
     _ec_jacobi_add1: 6.70M it/s ~ 0.90s
     _ec_jacobi_add2: 5.44M it/s ~ 1.10s
     _ec_jacobi_dbl1: 5.47M it/s ~ 1.10s
     _ec_jacobi_dbl2: 7.81M it/s ~ 0.77s
       ec_jacobi_mul: 0.02M it/s ~ 0.55s
       ec_gtable_mul: 0.32M it/s ~ 1.54s
       ec_affine_add: 0.31M it/s ~ 1.63s
       ec_affine_dbl: 0.31M it/s ~ 1.63s
   _fe_modinv_binpow: 0.20M it/s ~ 0.50s
   _fe_modinv_addchn: 0.31M it/s ~ 0.32s
              addr33: 4.84M it/s ~ 1.03s
              addr65: 4.27M it/s ~ 1.17s
```

_Note: Benchmark is run on a MacBook Pro M2._

## Build on Windows with WSL

I just leave here all steps I do to run `ecloop` on Windows.

1. Open PowerShell
2. `wsl --install`
3. Restart Windows
4. `wsl --install Ubuntu` (not sure it required, Ubuntu should be installed by default and this command hung when I tried it, so I continued in new tab)
5. `wsl -d Ubuntu`
6. `apt update && apt install build-essential git`
7. `git clone https://github.com/vladkens/ecloop.git && cd ecloop`
8. `make build`

If no errors appear, `ecloop` has been compiled successfully and is ready to use. For example, you can run a benchmark with: `./ecloop bench`.

## Disclaimer

This project is written to learn the math over elliptic curves in cryptocurrencies. Functionality as a search for Bitcoin Puzzles is added as a real-world use case.
